# FrskyParser

Documentation be will added as soon as we can get to it. We're focusing on getting [Via](https://github.com/copperpunk-elixir/via) up and running right now (which uses this package as a dependency). If you would like to use an FrSky SBus receiver with your Elixir project, visit www.copperpunk.com to drop us a line. We can surely get you on your way.

```
